# Server
The server application serves to provide the scraped data through a flask rest api.
No write endpoints exists, GET is the only allowed request method.

### Resources

- /blog/posts?page=0[&source={source_code}]
- /blog/posts/{id}
- /blog/sources
- /blog/sources/{source_code}

where:
- `source_code` is a string
- `id` is an integer

### Authorization

To be able to read data from the server, an authorization header needs to be present, containing a bearer token. 
This token is a base64 encoded image, and can be found in the resources folder.

### Installation
